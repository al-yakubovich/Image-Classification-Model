by Convolutional Neural Network

Computer vision and neural networks are the hot new IT of machine learning techniques. With advances of neural networks and an ability to read images as pixel density numbers, numerous companies are relying on this technique for more data. For example, speed camera uses computer vision to take pictures of license plate of cars who are going above the speeding limit and match the license plate number with their known database to send the ticket to. Although this is more related to Object Character Recognition than Image Classification, both uses computer vision and neural networks as a base to work.
